      "coordinates": [40.7831, -73.9712],
      "description": "Central library with study spaces and resources"
    }
  ]
}
```

### POST `/api/route`
Calculate shortest route between two buildings.

**Request Body:**
```json

## Usage Guide

### Finding a Route
1. Open the application in your web browser
2. Select a starting building from the "From" dropdown
3. Select a destination building from the "To" dropdown
4. Click "Find Route" button
5. View the calculated route on the map and route details in the sidebar

### Interactive Map Features
- Click on building markers to see information
- Use "Set as Start" or "Set as End" buttons in popups to quickly select buildings
- Click "Show Campus Overview" to see all buildings and paths

## Customization

### Adding New Buildings
1. Edit `campus_data.py`
2. Add new building entries to the `BUILDINGS` dictionary
3. Update the `campus_paths` list to connect new buildings to the graph
4. Restart the application

### Modifying Campus Layout
1. Update coordinates in `BUILDINGS` dictionary
2. Adjust paths in the `create_campus_graph()` function
3. Add or remove intersections as needed

### UI Customization
1. Modify CSS styles in `templates/index.html`
2. Update colors, fonts, and layout as desired
3. Add new interactive features in the JavaScript section

## Algorithm Details

### Dijkstra's Algorithm Implementation
- **Time Complexity:** O((V + E) log V) where V is vertices and E is edges
- **Space Complexity:** O(V) for storing distances and previous nodes
- **Optimized:** Uses priority queue (heapq) for efficient node selection

### Distance Calculation
- Uses Haversine formula for accurate GPS coordinate distance calculation
- Accounts for Earth's curvature
- Returns distances in meters for precise navigation

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Port Already in Use:**
```bash
# Kill process using port 5000 (Windows)
netstat -ano | findstr :5000
taskkill /PID <PID_NUMBER> /F
```

**Module Import Errors:**
```bash
# Reinstall dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt --force-reinstall
```

**Map Not Loading:**
- Check internet connection (required for map tiles)
- Verify JavaScript console for errors
- Ensure Flask server is running

## Performance Notes

- Application supports up to 1000+ buildings with proper optimization
- Graph algorithms scale well with campus size
- Frontend caches building data for improved performance
- Map rendering is optimized for smooth user experience

## Future Enhancements

- [ ] Real-time traffic/crowding data integration
- [ ] Multiple route options (shortest vs fastest)
- [ ] Indoor navigation for large buildings
- [ ] Mobile app version
- [ ] User preferences and saved routes
- [ ] Accessibility features for disabled users
- [ ] Integration with campus events and schedules
